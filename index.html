    <h2>Summary of Boston Harbor Cleanup:</h2>
    <p>The harbor at Boston was considered one of the dirtiest harbors by the 1980s. The large volume of sewage and wastewater that was being dumped into the harbor made it very polluted and unpleasant to the point that businesses and people avoided the area. After the Clean Water Act was passed, responsibility to clean up the water was passed onto the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority. About $3.8 billion was spent on this project. As a result, it led to a boom in economic activities from the growth of businesses, residential spaces, and recreational areas at the water front. It is now known as one of Americaâ€™s greatest environmental achievements. Discussed in the article, a study used to understand the economic impact of the Boston Harbor Cleanup concluded that the benefits and values received exceeds the costs of the cleanup.

    <h2>Land Cover Areas (acres) at MHHW by watershed</h2>
        <div id="table3">
        </div>
        <p>
            This graph illustrates the four different types of land cover for each area. One key takeaway is that "Forest", "Grassland/openland", "Core habitats", and "Coastal waters" have most diversity in land cover types compared to the other 9 areas.

        <h2>Annual Value of Ecosystem Service</h2>
        <div id="table5">
        </div>
        <p>
            In the visualization above, the annual value of ecosystem service is shown with the highest and lowest range for each of the thirteen land cover types. These are dollar amount values that would be lost without the cleanup. Main key takeaway is that the top values of service belong NWI Marine Wetlands, City Parks, and Forest. The total value of these services is equal to over 2 billion dollars.

        <h2>Annual Value of Ecosystem Services With and Without Cleanup</h2>
        <div id="table6">
        </div>
        <p>
            This graph shows the annual value of ecosystem services with and without cleanup. By looking at the three groups, the contrast between them is visibly seen. Particularly, the benefit of cleanup is valued at approximately 1 billion dollars.
